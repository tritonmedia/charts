Triton has been succesfully installed!

A few quick notes:

 * It's normal for triton-converter and triton-downloader to be unready, 
   that means they aren't currently processing any jobs
 * Triton doesn't provide an ingress controller or any monitoring by default
   you may want to install something like nginx-ingress, cert-manager, and etc.

Ok! Now that that's out of the way, you can access Triton at the following locations:

 * API: {{ $endpoints.events }} (API key is in the triton-events logs, or in postgres)
 * Jellyfin: {{ $endpoints.jellyfin }}
 * Plex: {{ $endpoints.plex }}

Do these not look like what you'd expect? Then update the endpoints.NAME value to change these,
be sure to update your DNS to target your ingress controller's IP to access these.

Alternatively, you can can port forward each of these with the following commands:

 * Jellyfin: kubectl port-forward deployment/triton-centers 8096 (access at: http://127.0.0.1:8096)
 * API: kubectl port-forward deployment/triton-events 3401 (access at: http://127.0.0.1:3401)
 * Plex: kubectl port-forward deployment/triton-centers 32400 (access at: http://127.0.0.1:32400)
